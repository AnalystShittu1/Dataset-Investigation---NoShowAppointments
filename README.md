# Dataset-Investigation---NoShowAppointments
## by Ibrahim SHITTU

## Project Overview
> In this project, we analyzed NoShow Appointment dataset and then communicate the findings about it. we used the Python libraries NumPy, pandas, and Matplotlib to make our analysis easier.

## Dataset Description 
> The NoShow Appointment dataset consist of 100k medical appointments information in Brazil and we tried to answer questions on a number of characteristics that would influence whether or not patients show up for their appointment. the dataset has 14 columns namely PatientId, AppointmentID, Gender, ScheduledDay, AppointmentDay, Age,	Neighbourhood, Scholarship,	Hipertension, Diabetes, Alcoholism,	Handcap, SMS_received, and No-show. This data table presents patient biodata, scheduled appointment, and remarks on wether or not they show up for thier appointment. Hence, "No-show" column is dependent variable while others are independent variaables for this project.

## Summary of Findings
> The result shows that fewer patients are enrolled for welfare scheme and does not suggest motivation for patients showing up for appointment. Also, Gender may be a determinant for engagement as more female book more appointment than male whereas this does not lead to signicant show-up/appointment ratio.
 
> However, future analysis may further inspect and code the dependent variable as numeric in a separate column to determine correllation/causation.

> limititation of the report is that dependent variable is text format such that correlation test with other variables cannot be readily checked
